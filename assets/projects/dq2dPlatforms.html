							<p>This was a group project that was developed and presented in front of the ACM commitee.
							The project converts any image format into a digital media format. The image color variation 
						  is reduced into a smaller set of variations. The user is prompted with a preview of the new 
						  image and selects their choice of foreground, background, start point, and end point by color. 
						  The image is rendered as as 2d platform game in which the user is free to move around based on
						  collision detection based on foreground and background.</p>

							<!-- The bitmap was then stored
							as pixels into an array. Each pixel RGB values are compared to a pre-made palette and changed
							to the closest match. This reduces any 32-bit image consisting of 16,777,216 color variations
							down to 27 RGB combinations of 0, 128, and 255. This allowed for easier collision detection
							within the game. -->
